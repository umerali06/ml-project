# Mini AI Pilot - Simulation Dashboard

## Overview
This is a Flask-based web application that provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing vehicle dispatch optimization data. The Mini AI Pilot uses machine learning to prioritize electric vehicle charging based on urgency, demand, and proximity factors.

## Project Purpose
The dashboard allows users to:
- View and filter vehicle dispatch lists based on priority scores
- Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for vehicle fleet management
- Analyze priority distribution, SOC (State of Charge) vs priority, and zone composition
- Recompute priority scores using custom weights and hub locations
- Upload custom CSV data for analysis

## Recent Changes
**2025-10-06**: Initial Replit setup
- Installed Python 3.11 and all required dependencies (Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly)
- Created .gitignore for Python project
- Configured Flask server workflow on port 5000
- Set up production deployment with Gunicorn (autoscale)
- Application successfully running and verified

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask 3.1.2 (Python web framework)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.3.3, NumPy 2.3.3
- **Visualization**: Plotly 6.3.1
- **Production Server**: Gunicorn 23.0.0
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3.2, custom CSS with dark theme

```

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic Priority Calculation**: Haversine distance algorithm for hub proximity
2. **Interactive Filters**: Zone, hour, and minimum priority filters
3. **Real-time Visualization**: 4 interactive Plotly charts
4. **CSV Upload**: Support for custom data uploads
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly dark theme interface

### Data Flow
1. Load CSV data (dispatch_list, top_50_dispatch, synthetic_gbfs)
2. Calculate priority scores based on:
   - Urgency: Time to reach 20% SOC
   - Demand: Zone demand score
   - Proximity: Distance to hub
3. Render interactive dashboard with KPIs and charts
4. Support real-time recomputation with custom parameters

## Configuration

### Development
- Server runs on `0.0.0.0:5000`
- Debug mode enabled in development
- Workflow: `python app.py`

### Production (Deployment)
- Uses Gunicorn with 2 workers
- Autoscale deployment target
- Command: `gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --workers=2 app:app`

## Data Files
The application expects three CSV files in the project root:
- `dispatch_list.csv`: Full vehicle dispatch list
- `top_50_dispatch.csv`: Top 50 priority vehicles
- `synthetic_gbfs.csv`: Synthetic GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification) data

These files are generated by the Jupyter notebook: `mini_ai_pilot_colab.ipynb`

## Dependencies
All Python dependencies are managed via pip and defined in `requirements.txt`:
- Flask (>=3.0, <4)
- NumPy (>=2.1)
- Pandas (>=2.2.3)
- Plotly (>=5.22)
- Gunicorn (>=21.2) - Linux/macOS only

## Development Notes
- The app uses Haversine formula for distance calculations
- Priority score is normalized and weighted (default: 60% urgency, 25% demand, 15% proximity)
- Charts use Plotly dark theme with custom colors matching the UI
- Client-side filtering implemented in JavaScript for performance

## User Preferences
None specified yet.

## Next Steps
- The application is fully functional and ready to use
- Users can upload their own CSV data or use the provided sample data
- All visualizations and filters are working correctly
