# Mini AI Pilot â€” Simulation Dashboard (Flask)

This lightweight Flask app renders an interactive dashboard to visualize the Mini AI Pilot results (dispatch list, Top-50, charts, KPIs).

## 1) Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2) Prepare data files in project root

- dispatch_list.csv (generated by the notebook)
- top_50_dispatch.csv (generated by the notebook)
- synthetic_gbfs.csv (generated by the notebook)

If you haven't generated them yet, open the notebook `mini_ai_pilot_colab.ipynb` and Run All.

## 3) Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## 4) Features
- KPIs: total vehicles, unique zones, average SOC, average distance to hub
- Charts: priority distribution, SOC vs priority (by zone), distance vs priority, Top-50 zone composition
- Tables: dispatch list (Top-100 preview), Top-50 preview
- Downloads: quick links to CSVs

## 5) Notes
- App auto-loads CSVs from the project root. Re-run the notebook to regenerate outputs anytime.
- For deployment, you can run with `gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app` (Linux/Mac).
